# Example: Feature importance visualization (assuming a trained model with feature importances)
# Replace with actual model and feature names in your case
feature_names = ['Feature 1', 'Feature 2', 'Feature 3', 'Feature 4']
importances = np.random.rand(4)  # Dummy feature importances; replace with actual data

# Plot feature importances

# If you have a trained model and can explain individual predictions, you can also add SHAP or LIME-based explanations.
