    Welcome to the Model Explainer App! This app allows you to explore machine learning models, 
    visualize their performance, and understand how they make predictions.
    
    This app includes:
    - An introduction to the model.
    - An explanation of the modelâ€™s predictions.
    - A look at the performance metrics.
    - Interactive tools for exploring different data inputs.
